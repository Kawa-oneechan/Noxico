How to play Noxico
<c15,8> Keys <c>

Arrow keys are obvious - they move your character.

<c0,7><gDD>L<gDE><c>  - Look at another character, also identify them. While the
       <b>+<b> targeting cursor is in view, you can press <c0,7><gDD>Enter<gDE><c> to
       examine the targeted character or <c0,7><gDD>Escape<gDE><c> to cancel.

<c0,7><gDD>F1<gDE><c> - This screen. While in a text scroller like this one, you
       can press the <c0,7><gDD><g18><gDE><c> and <c0,7><gDD><g19><gDE><c> arrow keys to scroll, as it
       states down below, see?

<c15,8> Editing <c>

Most of the stuff in the game is defined by a bunch of XML files.
The <b>Noxico.xml<b> file in particular defines all the creatures in the
game, both generic (and somewhat randomized) as well as the more
unique, one-of-a-kind encounters. One is specified by a <b>bodyplan<b>
element, the other by <b>unique<b>.

Several different elements can be applied to a <b>bodyplan<b> or <b>unique<b>:
<g7> <b>roll<b> - Is replaced by a unique value, based on the notation
  "1d<b>X<b>+<b>Y<b>", where the "+Y" part is optional.)
<g7> <b>oneof<b> - Is replaced by a random element from the list, based on
  the notation "foo,bar,baz".
<g7> <b>normalgenders<b> - Limits random gender choice to male or female.
<g7> <b>maleonly<b>, <b>femaleonly<b>, <b>hermonly<b> and <b>neuteronly<b> - Forces random
  genders to a specific value.
<g7> <b>tallness<b> - How tall the creature is.
<g7> <b>hair<b> - The creature has hair. Can have a <b>length<b> and a color.
<g7> <b>skin<b>, <b>fur<b>, <b>scales<b>, <b>slime<b> or <b>rubber<b> - The creature has skin of
  the specified type. Can have a color.
<g7> <b>eyes<b> - The creature can see. There being two of these is implied
  by the presence of the element in the first place. Is not
  actually used yet, but can later function to describe the amount
  and kind of eyes.
<g7> <b>ears<b> - The creature has external ears. Can be <b>human<b>, <b>elfin<b>,
  <b>horse<b>, <b>dog<b>, <b>cat<b> or <b>cow<b>.
<g7> <b>antennae<b>: The creature has a pair of antennae. They can't be
  specified in further detail than that just yet.
<g7> <b>legs<b>: The creature has a pair of legs. Can have <b>human<b> (default),
  <b>genbeast<b>, <b>cow<b> (also fit for horses), <b>dog<b>, <b>stiletto<b> (human, but
  with a heel-horn), <b>claws<b>, or <b>insect<b>.
<g7> <b>snaketail<b>: The creature does not have legs, but the lower body
  of a snake.
<g7> <b>ass<b>: The creature has a back exit. Asses can be <b>virgin<b> and
  <b>fuckable<b>, and have a <b>size<b>. They can also have a <b>looseness<b> and
  <b>wetness<b>.
<g7> <b>hips<b>: The creature has hips worth mentioning. Hips can only have
  a size.
<g7> <b>fertility<b>: If present and non-zero, the creature is capable of
  concieving a child. Childbirth requires a vagina, so be careful.
<g7> <b>breastrow<b>: Describes a single row of titties. <b>amount<b> defines the
  amount on this row, <b>size<b> is a rating, <b>nipples<b> lists their
  amount and <b>size<b> (0.20 assumed). If a nipple is <b>fuckable<b> or
  <b>canfuck<b>, they'll function as nipplecunts or dicknipples
  respectively. Not both. Breastrows can be a <b>milksource<b>, and you
  can specify a bunch.
<g7> <b>vagina<b>: Obvious. Vaginas can be <b>virgin<b> and <b>fuckable<b> (which they
  usually are), and can have a <b>clit<b> (which they usually do). The
  <b>clit<b> specifies its size. Vaginas can also have a <b>looseness<b> and
  <b>wetness<b>. You can specify several if you want.
<g7> <b>penis<b>: Also obvious. Penises have a <b>thickness<b> and <b>length<b>. They
  can be <b>cumsource<b> and <b>canfuck<b>, and <b>demon<b>, <b>horse<b>, or <b>knot<b>. You can
  specify more than one if you want.
<g7> <b>balls<b>: The creature has ballz. Without them, they can't properly
  impregnate a woman. They have an <b>amount<b> and a <b>size<b>, which
  directly influences cum production.
<g7> <b>wings<b>: The creature has wings. If they are <b>small<b>, they're just
  for display, otherwise, they're fit for breaking falls and
  passing fences. Wings can be <b>demon<b>, <b>insect<b> or <b>feather<b>.
<g7> <b>tail<b>: The creature has a tail. They can be <b>genbeast<b>, <b>horse<b>, <b>dog<b>,
  <b>cow<b>, <b>demon<b>, <b>spider<b> or <b>stinger<b>. Multiple tails are currently not
  supported. <b>stinger<b> and <b>spider<b> tails can have <b>venom<b> and <b>recharge<b>.
