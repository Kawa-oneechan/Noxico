;     tileset: Specifies which PNG file to use for the regular 256 characters.
;              Should be a tileset with 32 glyphs per row, 8 rows. Actual window
;              size is directly affected by this file. If the file doesn't exist,
;              a built-in tileset is used.
;     extiles: Basically the same deal as the tileset value, but for extra characters
;              beyond the usual range. The size of the glyphs in this file MUST match
;              that of the generic tileset or things will get very weird.
;  useextiles: Use the ExTiles tileset for certain things. Disable this for a more
;              "pure" visual experience.
;  doublesize: Draw at twice the size.
; interpolate: If drawing at twice the size, should the edges be blurred?
tileset=ascii.png
extiles=extended.png
useextiles=true
doublesize=false
interpolate=false

[audio]
;     enabled: Should be pretty obvious. Volume controls are ignored if false.
; musicvolume: From 0 to 100, how loud the music should be.
; soundvolume: From 0 to 100, how loud sound effects should be.
enabled=true
musicvolume=100
soundvolume=100

[saving]
; gzip: Compress the world data when saving. When loading, compression is
;       dictated by the savegame file itself.
; flip: Flip the high bits (0x00->0x80, 0x41->0xC1), same rules as with gzip
;       apply. You can set both of these if you want.
gzip=false
flip=false

[misc]
; rememberpause: Remember the active page on the Pause screen. If set to false,
;                opening the Pause screen will reset to the "Character stats"
;                page every time.
;      autorest: Specifies the timeout at which the game will automatically
;                press the Rest key, to give the illusion of realtime gameplay.
;                The lower, the faster.
;     skiptitle: Skip the title screen if there's already a game to restore.
;                Has no effect on a clean slate.
rememberpause=true
autorest=100
skiptitle=false
