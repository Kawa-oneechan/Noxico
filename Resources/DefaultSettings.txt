; This is the default configuration for Noxico. Feel free to adjust this as you see fit.

[font]
;   family: The font family name, like "Consolas", "DejaVu Sans Mono", or "Fixedsys".
;           If the font can't be loaded, the system's default monospace font is used.
;     size: The size in points.
;     bold: Obvious.
; x-adjust: Some fonts may need to be nudged. This and y-adjust will allow that.
;           Don't use too large values or things'll go wonky.
family=Consolas
size=11
bold=false
x-adjust=-2
y-adjust=-1

[audio]
;     enabled: Should be pretty obvious. Volume controls are ignored if false.
; musicvolume: From 0 to 100, how loud the music should be.
; soundvolume: From 0 to 100, how loud sound effects should be.
enabled=true
musicvolume=100

[saving]
; gzip: Compress the world data when saving. When loading, compression is
;       dictated by the savegame file itself.
; flip: Flip the high bits (0x00->0x80, 0x41->0xC1), same rules as with gzip
;       apply. You can set both of these if you want.
gzip=false
flip=false

[misc]
; rememberpause: Remember the active page on the Pause screen. If set to false,
;                opening the Pause screen will reset to the "Character stats"
;                page every time.
;      autorest: Specifies the timeout at which the game will automatically
;                press the Rest key, to give the illusion of realtime gameplay.
;                The lower, the faster.
;     skiptitle: Skip the title screen if there's already a game to restore.
;                Has no effect on a clean slate.
rememberpause=true
autorest=100
