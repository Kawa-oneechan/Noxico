			The [b:title] breathes raggedly as [b:he] lays on the ground, [b:his] former aggressiveness soundly beaten out of [b:him]. [b:He] looks up at you pleadingly as [b:his] hips fruitlessly grind on the earth.

		<p/>
		<p>
			You smirk and silently agree that taking advantage of [b:her] unspoken offer could be a nice diversion.

			After you spend some more time looking at the pitiful [b:title], you can't help but feel that [b:he] wouldn't be able to give much back. You decide to leave [b:him] to take care of [b:him]self and try to find someone more worth your time.
