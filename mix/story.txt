It was quite some time ago that the people of this world were prosperous and
advanced. Some would say we'd grown... arrogant, perhaps? That what happened
next was entirely our own doing. Others would dispute that notion. Regardless,
what's done is done, and what happened, has happened, no matter the root
cause...
¦
Noone quite expected it but one person, his name first cursed then long
forgotten, was believed to have brought the attention of the Rose Mistress to
our world.
¦
Melfina, she called herself. And with her, she brought an army. Of course, we
humans had our own armies, and weapons that would strike fear into the heart of
any creature intelligent enough to consider what forces hide in a nuclear
device.
¦
As it turns out, the forces of what some might consider Hell, but we now know
as Deveah...¦scoff at such a silly notion.
¦
¦
Our world never quite did recover.
