## Bestiary II
<b>Felinoid</b> 

<b>Quick summary</b> 
Felinoids are intelligent, bipedal creatures that resemble cats to some degree. Most are traders or entertainers. 

<b>Origins</b> 
The felinoid people came into being during the First Demon War. The first felinoids were created by the demon invaders from regular non-sentient felines inhabiting the islands off to the west. They were originally intended to serve as warriors in the demon army, but cats are known to not take orders -- a fact that the demons were sorely uninformed about. Remaining mostly neutral in the war, the felinoids survived to the end and travelled all over the mainland as nomads. Over time, they outgrew their demonic taint and began to slowly be accepted by mankind. 

<b>Biology</b> 
Felinoids have a thick coat of fur, usually some warm, muted color, and a bestial facial structure. They can freely interbreed with men, which has produced two subtypes of felinoids; one digitigrade, the other plantigrade. Most felinoids have particularly vicious claws, and (compared to humans) above-average athletic skills.
