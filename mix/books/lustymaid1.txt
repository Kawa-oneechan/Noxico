Act IV, Scene III, continued 

Lifts-Her-Tail: Certainly not, kind sir! I am here but to clean your chambers. 

Crantius Colto: Is that all you have come here for, little one? My chambers? 

Lifts-Her-Tail: I have no idea what it is you imply, master. I am but a poor Argonian maid. 

Crantius Colto: So you are, my dumpling. And a good one at that. Such strong legs and shapely tail. 

Lifts-Her-Tail: You embarrass me, sir! 

Crantius Colto: Fear not. You are safe here with me. 

Lifts-Her-Tail: I must finish my cleaning, sir. The mistress will have my head if I do not! 

Crantius Colto: Cleaning, eh? I have something for you. Here. Polish my spear. 

Lifts-Her-Tail: But it is huge! It could take me all night! 

Crantius Colto: Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.
