Lifts-Her-Tail: My goodness, that's quite a loaf! But how ever shall it fit my oven? 

Crantius Colto: This loaf isn't ready for baking, my sweet. It has yet to rise. 

Lifts-Her-Tail: If only we could hurry that along. How would I accomplish such a task? 

Crantius Colto: Oh, my foolish little Argonian maid, you must use your hands. 

Lifts-Her-Tail: You wish me to knead the loaf? Here? 

Crantius Colto: Of course. 

Lifts-Her-Tail: But what if the mistress catches me? Your loaf was meant to satisfy her appetite. 

Crantius Colto: Don't fret, my delicate flower. I'll satisfy the mistress' cravings later. 

Lifts-Her-Tail: Very well, but I'm afraid my oven isn't hot enough. It could take hours! 

Crantius Colto: Plenty of time, my sweet. Plenty of time.
