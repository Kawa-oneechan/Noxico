##The Story of Brian the Bold and the Dragon Red
The Story of Brian the Bold and the Dragon Red

Come in close and listen well
To the story I now do tell
About Brian the Bold and the Dragon, Red
A tale most naughty as ever been said

Brian was strong, mighty and proud
The Dragon, Red, monstrous and loud
In the dead of night did Brian creep
Upon the Red Dragon whilst it sleep

Now is the time! Brian did think
but on his approach spotted something pink.
Scalely I be not! Brian did sputter
But the sight made him hot and his heart start to flutter.

A hole is a hole Brian's father did say
And in the dead of night Brian did lay
Upon the morrow at the sight of dawn
Did Brian awake with a stretch and a yawn

A deep satisfied rumbled reached his ears
From Red, the Dragon whom he brought to tears
With his mighty sword, long and made of pork
A claim he would boast from here to York.

So there be the tale of Brian the Bold
Never a grander tale had ever been told
So if you cometh across a Dragon named Red
Do not slay the beast, but take her to bed.
