## Bestiary I - Slimes
## 
<b>Racial traits</b> 
Racially, slimes are extraordinarily distinct. Their most prolific feature is that their bodies are composed entirely of a semi-translucent, viscous, gelatinous material. The exact viscosity and transparency vary from slime to slime. They have a thicker, leather-like membrane on the outside of their bodies that serves as a skin, which is smooth, warm and slightly humid to the touch. They have monochromatic skin, which comes in a wide variety of colors. They possess pupil-less eyes, that are usually a different shade of color from the rest of their bodies, but never a different color entirely. Slimes usually do not wear clothing, since they do not feel discomfort from heat or the cold. They only wear armor or clothing to differentiate themselves from one another and protect themself. There are slimes that possess less intelligence than others, thus they are regarded as uncivilized subspecies by other natives of Nox. All and all, they are an adaptable species that can survive in almost any environment, provided they have a ready supply of "food". 

<b>Physical traits</b> 
Slimes strongly manifest whichever sexual characteristic they gravitate towards when they develop an personal identity, some slimes have wide shoulders, masculine features, angled faces, and a phallus. Other slimes have feminine facial features, plush lips, thin waists, large breasts, wide hips and plump rumps. It is not uncommon to find slimes who possess the features of the latter and the phallus of the former. All slimes possess gooey hair that flows freely from their heads, stray strands of vicious hair follicles are reabsorbed by their bodies as they fall off as syrupy droplets. 

<b>Society</b> 
As a whole, slimes tend to be outsiders from most of society, rarely forming into groups of more than two or three. They do, however, gravitate towards larger settlements; slimes are the closest to being wild of any of the civil races in the realm of Nox, with some some wild slimes being unable to speak. Still, settled areas are hubs for "food" and protection, both of which slimes seek out. Although generally characterized as being somewhat lacking in mental aptitude, it would be far more accurate to say that slimes possess a vastly different set of values relative to other species. (See also "blue and orange morality" in any respectable dictionary) 

<b>Physiology</b> 
Slimes possess several unique biological features. While even the most exotic creatures in Nox are still composed of bones, cartilage, and muscle, with some sort of respiratory and circulatory system, the body of a slime is composed of only five different types of tissue: skin, eye, digestive, reproductive, and muscle. Slimes secrete an aphrodisiac from their bodies, which increases in potency as they become more aroused. Those who have been exposed to it describe the experience as "really hot" for a lack of more elegant words. This natural chemical can be "harvested" from the body of an slime, and preserved in some readily available container for future use. 

The outermost layer of a slime's body is skin tissue, an amorphous solid that is soft to a gentle touch, but hardens in proportion to the force exacted on it. Slimes do not exert conscious control over this tissue, instead relying on connecting tissues to move and shape it. Slimes are capable of converting muscle and skin tissue into one another, although this takes some time. If left without a skin membrane on its outer body, slimes lose the ability to control the shape of their body, leaving them as a lump or blob. 

Muscle tissue composes the vast majority of a slime's body. It is a viscous fluid capable of expanding and contracting, as well as connecting to nearby tissues. Combined with a rigid internal or external structure, it allows slimes a great deal of control over their shape and overall appearance. 

The digestive system of a slime is specifically designed to process sexual fluids, deriving nutrition from breast milk, sperm, or female excretions. Slimes then convert the newly processed fluids into more muscular tissue. 

Slimes are asexual and reproduce by mitosis, yet manifest distinct male, female and hermaphroditic physical characteristics. Reproductive processes are a separate part of a female or herm slime's mind, being compatible with their biology, but not truly a part of it. It acts as an slime's natural survival mechanism, allowing them to build a bud of muscle and digestive tissue independent of its own sentience, which allows this newly independent lump to begin developing an intelligence of its own, thus reproducing. In order to prevent direct cloning in this fashion, when slimes are ready to reproduce they seek out others of their kind to contribute in the formation of a new slime or by finding a "host" from another intelligent species and implanting the bud within their bodies, letting it incubate within the surrogate mother. In either case this allows the species as a whole to become more diverse. 

Young slimes take some time to learn how to properly control their body, remaining as small blobs. During this time they cannot reliably generate digestive tissue on their own, and are reliant on their parents. Female and herm slimes produce a thick, syrupy liquid concoction known as ambrosia designed specifically to feed their offspring. Ambrosia's flavor can only be associated with a slime's color and many decedent individuals endeavor to try them all. Slimes will generally store ambrosia in their breasts and engage in breast feeding as a sort of maternal instinct. By the time young slimes reach maturity, they can form their own digestive tissue reliably, learning how to form bodies, associate themselves with a gender by instinct, and most importantly, feed.
