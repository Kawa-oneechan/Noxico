## Bestiary II
<b>Felin</b> 

<b>Quick summary</b> 
Felin are intelligent, bipedal creatures that resemble cats to some degree. Most are traders or entertainers. 

<b>Origins</b> 
The felin are believed to have come from the stars some time after the First Demon War. They brought various advanced technologies to share with the rest of the world, though most of the really advanced gear is non-functional.

<b>Biology</b> 
Felin have a thick coat of fur, usually some warm, muted color, and a bestial but soft facial structure. To their own surprise, they can freely interbreed with men. Most felin have particularly vicious claws, and (compared to humans) above-average athletic skills. It is generally considered very difficult to determine if a pureblooded felin is male or female as they all tend to have the soft physique of a woman, and have neglible breasts.
