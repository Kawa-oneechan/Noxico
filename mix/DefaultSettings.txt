; This is the default configuration for Noxico. Feel free to adjust this as you see fit.

[font]
;    family: The font family name, like "Consolas", "DejaVu Sans Mono", or "Fixedsys".
;            If the font can't be loaded, the system's default monospace font is used.
;      size: The size in points.
;      bold: Obvious.
;  x-adjust: Some fonts may need to be nudged. This and y-adjust will allow that.
;            Don't use too large values or things'll go wonky.
; cellwidth: This and cellheight can be used to override the automatic cell size
;            detection. If set to zero, the cell size will be (badly) determined
;            automatically.
; cleartype: Enables or disables font smoothing.
family=Courier
size=10
bold=false
x-adjust=-2
y-adjust=0
cellwidth=8
cellheight=16

[audio]
;     enabled: Should be pretty obvious. Volume controls are ignored if false.

[misc]
; rememberpause: Remember the active page on the Pause screen. If set to false,
;                opening the Pause screen will reset to the "Character stats"
;                page every time.
;      autorest: Specifies the timeout at which the game will automatically
;                press the Rest key, to give the illusion of realtime gameplay.
;                The lower, the faster.
;    vistasaves: Save to %USERPROFILE%\Saved Games on Windows Vista and 7.
;                Has no effect on any other operating system.
;      savepath: Specifies where to save world data. Can be an absolute or
;                relative path. If preceded with "$", that part of the path
;                is taken to be %APPDATA% on Windows, or ~/.config on Linux.
;      shotpath: Specifies where to put screenshots. Same deal as savepath.
;     candytron: If your copy is built to support it, enables Candytron Mode,
;                a modern-looking fullscreen mode.
;       pngmode: If your copy is built to support it, enables PNG Font Mode,
;                which replaces the TTF renderer with a bitmap engine like the
;                first private releases had. If Candytron Mode is enabled,
;                PNG Mode is automatically disabled.
;       pngfont: Specifies which set of font bitmaps to use in PNG Mode.

;             cga: Convert the colors to the standard 16 color CGA palette. Sucks.
