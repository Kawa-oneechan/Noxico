As if on cue, a clearly feminine figure slinks out from within one of the side rooms and starts to approach Natalie from behind. As she passes through the light, her nature becomes clearer - her short, nubby horns, her six foot long spaded tail, and her narrow wings are quite demonic, but her outfit suggests even more; she wears a shiny black leather strapless bra supporting a luscious pair of large breasts, matching panties that leave no part of her hips unexposed; her arms bear long fingerless gloves made from a black fabric, and her legs are covered with a pair of black knee-length stockings, ending in a pair of high-heels in the same shiny black. A blood-red ruby, cut in a teardrop shape and mounted point-down hangs by a thin gold chain from a loop in the front of the thin black collar around her neck. Her mid-back-length straight brown hair affords the only innocent look on the girl, contrasting well with her deep red eyes.

 The sound of her heels on the marble is barely noticeable as she approaches Natalie from behind. A clearly mischievous smirk adorns her face as she flexes her fingers a bit as she gets closer.
