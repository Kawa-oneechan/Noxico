dungeon navigation tips
````````````````````````
To go down, any stairs down will do. If you can't see any stairs, take passages sideways until you find stairs down.
If you just can't find any stairs down, look for the reward chest. If you can't find either stairs or chest, it's a bug.
Going up is similar. Take passages until you find stairs upwards.
