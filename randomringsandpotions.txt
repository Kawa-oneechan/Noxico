Ring and potion effects
-----------------------
For rings, the effect lasts until the ring is removed. For potions, the effect
lasts a certain in-game time period. Exceptions are noted. Exactly what the
duration of a potion's effect is remains to be determined, but perhaps the
potion could have modifiers to adjust the duration. There's no such thing as
a cursed potion -- those are silently altered to have permanent duration and
maybe the opposite effect, should they be generated.

What's not listed here are items that cause species morphing such as the Foxite
testing item, even if some specific items are presented to the player as
potions. Morph items always have a permanent effect that can only be reversed by
using the opposite morph item.
