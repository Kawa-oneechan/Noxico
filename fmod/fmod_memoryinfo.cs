        Structure to be filled with detailed memory usage information of an FMOD object

        [REMARKS]
        Every public FMOD class has a getMemoryInfo function which can be used to get detailed information on what memory resources are associated with the object in question. 
        On return from getMemoryInfo, each member of this structure will hold the amount of memory used for its type in bytes.<br>
        <br>
        Members marked with [in] mean the user sets the value before passing it to the function.<br>
        Members marked with [out] mean FMOD sets the value to be used after the function exits.<br>
